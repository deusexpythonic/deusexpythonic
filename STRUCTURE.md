# Structure

This field is composed of four layers:

## 1. Invariants
Non-negotiable properties.  
Define the state that cannot change.

## 2. Threshold
Activation conditions.  
Define the boundary of the field.

## 3. Operations
Permitted actions.  
Define the only possible interactions.

## 4. Reversibility
Exit conditions.  
Define the return to zero-state.

## Spatial Layout

README.md  
INVARIANTS.md  
THRESHOLD.md  
OPERATIONS.md  
REVERSIBILITY.md  

No hierarchy.  
No dependency.  
No sequence.  
No progression.

Each file is autonomous.  
Each file is sufficient.  
Each file is reversible.

## Ontology

Not a project.  
Not a product.  
Not a service.  
Not a protocol.  
Not a narrative.  
Not a community.

A static field.  
A sovereign object.  
A non-reciprocal structure.
